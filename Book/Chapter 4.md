# **Chapter 4: Initiating the Project**

Welcome to the first step in the project life cycle: **Initiating the Project**. This crucial phase lays the groundwork for a successful project by formally recognizing its existence and defining its initial scope and objectives. Think of it as the official "kick-off" where the project is authorized, and the project manager is empowered to begin assembling the resources needed.

In this chapter, we will explore the key processes involved in initiating a project, including developing the **project charter** and identifying **stakeholders**. These processes are essential for ensuring that the project is aligned with organizational goals, has the necessary support, and that everyone involved understands their roles and responsibilities.

## **The Importance of Proper Initiation**

Initiating a project correctly is critical to its overall success. A well-defined project charter and a comprehensive understanding of stakeholder needs provide a solid foundation for the planning and execution phases that follow. Without proper initiation, projects can suffer from:

*   **Lack of Clarity:**  Unclear objectives, scope, and deliverables can lead to confusion and misdirection.
*   **Misaligned Expectations:**  Stakeholders may have different understandings of the project's purpose and outcomes.
*   **Insufficient Resources:**  Without formal authorization, it can be difficult to secure the necessary resources (people, budget, materials).
*   **Lack of Support:**  Without stakeholder buy-in, the project may face resistance or a lack of cooperation.

## **Key Processes in Initiating**

The Initiating process group consists of two fundamental processes:

1. **Develop Project Charter:** This is the process of creating the project charter, a document that formally authorizes the project and provides the project manager with the authority to apply organizational resources to project activities.
2. **Identify Stakeholders:** This is the process of identifying all individuals, groups, or organizations that could impact or be impacted by the project, analyzing their expectations and influence, and developing strategies for effectively engaging them.

Let's delve into each of these processes in more detail.

## **Develop Project Charter: The Project's Birth Certificate**

The **project charter** is a high-level document that formally authorizes the existence of a project. It's like the project's birth certificate, providing a concise overview of the project's purpose, objectives, and overall approach. It also names the project manager and defines their level of authority.

**Purpose of the Project Charter:**

*   **Formal Authorization:**  Officially sanctions the project and grants the project manager the authority to use organizational resources.
*   **High-Level Definition:** Provides a preliminary delineation of roles and responsibilities, project purpose, objectives, and scope.
*   **Alignment with Strategy:** Links the project to the organization's strategic objectives.
*   **Commitment:** Demonstrates management's commitment to the project.
*   **Common Understanding:** Creates a shared understanding of the project's key aspects among stakeholders.

**Inputs to Developing the Project Charter:**

Several inputs are used to create the project charter. These inputs provide information about the project's context, justification, and objectives:

*   **Business Documents:**
    *   **Business Case:** Describes the justification for the project, including the business need and the expected benefits. It explains why the project is needed and what it will achieve.
    *   **Benefits Management Plan:** Outlines how and when the project's benefits will be delivered and measured.
*   **Agreements:** Contracts or agreements with external entities (e.g., clients, vendors) that may have initiated the project.
*   **Enterprise Environmental Factors (EEFs):**  Internal and external factors that can influence the project, such as organizational culture, industry standards, government regulations, market conditions, and infrastructure.
*   **Organizational Process Assets (OPAs):**  Internal organizational assets that can be used to inform the project, such as policies, procedures, templates, historical information from previous projects, and lessons learned.

**Tools and Techniques for Developing the Project Charter:**

Several tools and techniques are used to facilitate the creation of the project charter:

*   **Expert Judgment:**  Soliciting input from individuals or groups with specialized knowledge or expertise related to the project, industry, or business area.
*   **Data Gathering:**
    *   **Brainstorming:**  Generating ideas and gathering information from a group of stakeholders.
    *   **Focus Groups:**  Facilitated discussions with selected stakeholders to gather their perspectives and expectations.
    *   **Interviews:** One-on-one conversations with key stakeholders to gather information and understand their needs.
*   **Interpersonal and Team Skills:**
    *   **Conflict Management:** Resolving any disagreements or conflicting viewpoints among stakeholders.
    *   **Facilitation:**  Guiding discussions and ensuring that all stakeholders have an opportunity to contribute.
    *   **Meeting Management:**  Planning and conducting effective meetings to gather input and make decisions.
*   **Meetings:**  Bringing stakeholders together to discuss the project, gather information, and reach consensus on the project charter's content.

**Outputs of Developing the Project Charter:**

The primary output of this process is the **project charter** itself. A typical project charter includes the following elements:

*   **Project Title and Description:** A concise name and description of the project.
*   **Project Purpose or Justification:**  The business need that the project addresses. Why are we doing this project?
*   **Measurable Project Objectives and Related Success Criteria:**  Specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) objectives that define what the project will achieve and how success will be measured.
*   **High-Level Requirements:** A summary of the key features and functions of the project's deliverables.
*   **High-Level Project Description:** Provides more detail about the project's approach and deliverables.
*   **Summary Milestone Schedule:**  A high-level timeline showing major project milestones.
*   **Key Stakeholder List:**  A list of individuals or groups who have an interest in or influence on the project.
*   **Project Approval Requirements:**  Defines what constitutes project success, who decides the project is successful, and who signs off on the project.
*   **Assigned Project Manager, Responsibility, and Authority Level:**  Identifies the project manager and defines their responsibilities and authority.
*   **Name and Authority of the Sponsor or Other Person(s) Authorizing the Project Charter:**  Identifies the individual(s) who are authorizing the project.
*   **Summary Budget:** A high-level estimate of the project's overall cost.
*   **High-Level Risks:** A summary of the major risks that could affect the project.

The second output of this process is the **Assumption Log**. This is where initial project and phase-level assumptions and constraints are recorded.

**Example Project Charter Elements:**

Let's say a company is launching a project to develop a new mobile app. The project charter might include the following:

*   **Project Title:**  New Mobile App Development
*   **Project Purpose:** To develop a user-friendly mobile app that will increase customer engagement and generate new revenue streams.
*   **Measurable Objectives:**
    *   Achieve a 4.5-star rating in app stores within six months of launch.
    *   Acquire 10,000 new users within the first three months.
    *   Generate $50,000 in revenue from in-app purchases within the first year.
*   **Project Manager:** Sarah Johnson, with the authority to manage the project budget, resources, and schedule.

## **Identify Stakeholders: Building Relationships for Success**

The **Identify Stakeholders** process is about systematically identifying everyone who might be affected by or have an influence on your project. Understanding your stakeholders' needs, expectations, and potential impact is essential for building positive relationships and ensuring their support throughout the project life cycle.

**Who are Stakeholders?**

Stakeholders can be individuals, groups, or organizations that:

*   Are actively involved in the project.
*   Have interests that may be positively or negatively affected by the project's execution or completion.
*   Can influence the project, its deliverables, or the project team.

**Examples of Stakeholders:**

*   **Project Sponsor:** The individual or group providing financial resources for the project.
*   **Customers:** The individuals or groups who will use the project's product, service, or result.
*   **Project Team:** The individuals performing the work of the project.
*   **Functional Managers:** Managers responsible for resources in specific departments.
*   **Operations Management:** Those who will inherit the project deliverables.
*   **Sellers/Business Partners:** External companies providing services or materials to the project.
*   **Government Regulatory Agencies:**  Agencies that may have regulations that impact the project.
*   **End Users:** People who will directly use the product of the project.

**Inputs to Identify Stakeholders:**

*   **Project Charter:** Provides information about the project's objectives, key stakeholders, and sponsor.
*   **Business Documents:**
    *   **Business Case:**  May identify initial stakeholders impacted by the project.
    *   **Benefits Management Plan:** Will highlight stakeholders who will be involved in receiving project benefits.
*   **Project Management Plan:** Components such as the communications management plan and stakeholder engagement plan, although developed later, can be consulted if available.
*   **Agreements:** Contracts and agreements may identify parties who have a contractual relationship with the project.
*   **Enterprise Environmental Factors (EEFs):** Organizational culture, political climate, industry standards, and regulations can all influence who your stakeholders are.
*   **Organizational Process Assets (OPAs):** Stakeholder registers from previous projects, lessons learned, and organizational charts can be valuable resources.

**Tools and Techniques for Identifying Stakeholders:**

*   **Expert Judgment:**  Consulting with individuals who have experience working with similar projects or in the same industry.
*   **Data Gathering:**
    *   **Questionnaires and Surveys:**  Gathering information from a large number of potential stakeholders.
    *   **Brainstorming:**  Generating a list of potential stakeholders in a group setting.
*   **Data Analysis:**
    *   **Stakeholder Analysis:** A systematic process of gathering and analyzing information about stakeholders to understand their interests, influence, and potential impact on the project. This often involves assessing their power, interest, influence, and attitude towards the project.
    *   **Document Analysis:** Reviewing project documents, contracts, and other relevant information to identify stakeholders.
*   **Data Representation:**
    *   **Stakeholder Mapping/Representation:** Visualizing stakeholders and their relationships to the project and to each other. Common techniques include:
        *   **Power/Interest Grid:** Classifying stakeholders based on their level of power and interest in the project.
        *   **Power/Influence Grid:** Classifying stakeholders based on their level of power and their ability to influence the project.
        *   **Influence/Impact Grid:** Grouping stakeholders based on their active involvement (influence) and their ability to effect changes to the project's planning or execution (impact).
        *   **Salience Model:**  Describing classes of stakeholders based on their power (ability to impose their will), urgency (need for immediate attention), and legitimacy (their involvement is appropriate).
*   **Meetings:**  Holding meetings with relevant individuals and groups to discuss and identify potential stakeholders.

**Outputs of Identify Stakeholders:**

*   **Stakeholder Register:** The primary output of this process. It's a document that contains information about identified stakeholders, such as:
    *   **Identification Information:** Name, title, role, contact information.
    *   **Assessment Information:**  Requirements, expectations, influence level, interest level, potential impact on the project.
    *   **Stakeholder Classification:**  Internal/external, supporter/neutral/resistor, or classifications from stakeholder mapping.
*   **Change Requests:** The stakeholder identification process may reveal the need for changes to the project, leading to change requests.
*   **Project Management Plan Updates:**  Information from the stakeholder register may be used to update the project management plan, particularly the stakeholder engagement plan and communications management plan (which are developed later in the Planning process group).
* **Project Documents Updates:** You may need to update your Assumption log, Issue Log, or Risk Register based on new information.

**Example Stakeholder Register Entries:**

| Stakeholder       | Role            | Interest Level | Influence Level | Expectations                                      | Classification |
| :---------------- | :-------------- | :------------- | :-------------- | :------------------------------------------------ | :------------- |
| John Smith        | Project Sponsor | High           | High            | Timely project completion within budget          | Internal       |
| Jane Doe          | Customer        | High           | Medium          | User-friendly and reliable mobile app            | External       |
| David Lee         | Marketing Mgr   | Medium         | Medium          | Successful product launch and market penetration | Internal       |
| ABC Regulations   | Regulatory Body | Low            | High            | Compliance with all applicable regulations      | External       |

## **The Importance of Ongoing Stakeholder Identification**

It's important to remember that identifying stakeholders is not a one-time activity. New stakeholders may emerge throughout the project life cycle, and the needs and expectations of existing stakeholders may change. Therefore, it's crucial to revisit and update the stakeholder register regularly.

**In Conclusion:**

The Initiating process group, with its focus on developing the project charter and identifying stakeholders, sets the stage for a successful project. By formally authorizing the project, defining its initial scope and objectives, and understanding the needs and expectations of stakeholders, you create a solid foundation for the planning and execution phases that follow. In the next chapter, we will move into the Planning process group, where we will develop the detailed roadmap for achieving the project's objectives.
