Delivery ensures the project produces tangible and intangible outputs that provide value to stakeholders and the organization.

- **Key Practices**:
  - Focus on delivering outcomes that align with stakeholder expectations and organizational strategy.
  - Ensure that deliverables are tested, validated, and accepted by stakeholders.

- **Key Practices**:
  - Define key performance indicators (KPIs) and success criteria for the project.
  - Use data-driven techniques to monitor progress, such as Earned Value Management (EVM).
  - Conduct regular reviews to assess project health and make necessary adjustments.

- **Desired Outcomes**:
  - Greater visibility into project performance and potential issues.
  - Improved decision-making based on accurate data.
  - Enhanced ability to meet project objectives on time and within budget.

---

#### **7. Uncertainty and Risk Management**
Managing uncertainty and risks is essential for navigating the inherent unpredictability of projects.

- **Key Practices**:
  - Identify potential risks and opportunities early in the project lifecycle.
  - Develop risk response plans, including mitigation, transfer, acceptance, or exploitation strategies.
  - Monitor and adapt to emerging risks throughout the project.

- **Desired Outcomes**:
  - Reduced likelihood and impact of negative risks.
  - Increased ability to capitalize on opportunities.
  - Enhanced resilience and adaptability in the face of uncertainty.
