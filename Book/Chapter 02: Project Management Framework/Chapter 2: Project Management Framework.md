### Chapter 2: Project Management Framework

---

#### **Definitions**
To understand the project management framework, it’s essential to distinguish between key concepts like project, program, portfolio, and operations.

##### **Project**:
A **project** is a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service, or result. It has:
- **Defined start and end dates**.
- A **specific scope**, with deliverables tailored to meet the project objectives.
- Examples: Developing a new app, constructing a building, or launching a marketing campaign.

##### **Program**:
A **program** is a group of related projects managed in a coordinated manner to achieve benefits that wouldn’t be realized if managed individually. 
- Programs focus on interdependencies between projects.
- Example: A company’s digital transformation program includes multiple projects like software development, training, and infrastructure upgrades.

##### **Portfolio**:
A **portfolio** is a collection of projects, programs, and operations managed to achieve strategic business objectives.
- Portfolios are aligned with an organization’s strategic goals and may include unrelated projects or programs.
- Example: A technology company’s portfolio may include R&D initiatives, product launches, and operational improvements.

##### **Operations**:
Operations are the ongoing, repetitive activities performed to sustain a business. Unlike projects, operations focus on maintaining consistency and efficiency in processes.
- Examples: Manufacturing, customer service, and IT support.

#### **Project Lifecycle and Phases**

   - Create detailed plans for scope, schedule, cost, quality, resources, risk, and communication.
   - Deliverables: Project Management Plan and Baselines.

3. **Execution**:
   - Carry out the project plan by coordinating resources and activities.
   - Manage stakeholder expectations and ensure deliverables meet quality standards.
   - Deliverable: Work Results (e.g., products, services).

4. **Monitoring and Controlling**:
   - Track project performance against baselines.
   - Implement corrective actions for variances.
   - Deliverable: Performance Reports and Updates.

#### **Organizational Influences and Structures**
The success of a project is heavily influenced by the organization’s structure and culture. Understanding these influences helps project managers tailor their approaches.

##### **Organizational Influences**:
1. **Culture and Style**:
   - Organizational culture affects decision-making, communication, and project support.
   - A culture emphasizing collaboration and innovation can positively impact projects.

2. **Governance**:
   - Governance frameworks establish decision-making authority, resource allocation, and reporting.

3. **Maturity and Project Management Practices**:
   - Organizations with established project management practices and tools often experience higher project success rates.

##### **Organizational Structures**:
The structure determines the project manager’s authority and the level of support a project receives.

1. **Functional**:
   - Departments are organized by function (e.g., marketing, finance, IT).
   - The project manager has limited authority, and functional managers control resources.

2. **Projectized**:
   - The organization is structured around projects.
   - The project manager has high authority and controls resources and decision-making.

3. **Matrix**:
   - Combines functional and projectized structures.
   - **Weak Matrix**: Functional manager authority dominates.
   - **Balanced Matrix**: Authority is shared between functional and project managers.
   - **Strong Matrix**: Project manager authority dominates.
